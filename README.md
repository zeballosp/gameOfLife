## 🛠️ **Install `dotnet-ef`**
1. Ensure you have the `dotnet-ef` tool installed.  
   - To install it, run:  
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
If you can't run the command, install dotnet-ef globally using:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```
## 🛠️ **Connection String**

1. Check the connection string in appsettings.json.
The database is configured for a local instance of an SQL Server, assuming a database named **GameOfLifeDB** exists.
Confirm that the connection string is correct in appsettings.json.
